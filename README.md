#Welcome!

This is Kirstie's fork of the the Mozilla Clubs Event Reporting tool. It allows users to submit and browse through event reports.

The plan is to fiddle with it until it works nicely for the [STEMM Role Models](www.stemmrolemodels.com) project!


##This is a prototype

This is a work in progress and uses test data for now.

##Some Links##

* [The Google Form](http://goo.gl/forms/wDc7b8AqI3)
  * Used to submit event reports
* [The Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QHl2bjBhMslyFzR5XXPzMLdzzx7oeSKTbgR5PM8qp64/edit#gid=1045576576)
  * This is where all the data lives
* [Event Report Dashboard](http://mozilla.github.io/clubs-events/)
  * Displays the reports

##How it works

1. Users submit an event report using the Google Form above
2. The data from the form is then added to the Spreadsheet
3. We access the spreadsheet using [Sheetsu](https://sheetsu.com/)
  * This gives us handy JSON data
4. We display the data on the Dashboard
